I just made my second game with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) for the [Ludum Dare 55](https://ludumdare.com/) game jam in 48 hours! This was an amazing experience as I was able to work with two extremely talented people, [Jaylus](https://roman-hyacinths.itch.io/) who did the art, and [Gadsada](https://www.eranan.com/) who composed the music and sound effects.
