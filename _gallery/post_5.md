My first trip into the world of game development. This was made over 4 months of on-and-off development with a team of ~10 people as part of the Turing Club (the coding club) activities at IISER Mohali. The game was built using a very simple 'game engine', called [**Tetra**](github.com/dhruvaSambrani/turing-hunt-engine) that I developed under the lead of my friend, [Dhruva](dhruvasambrani.github.io/). The result wasn't particularly fancy or well-made, but working on this with my wonderful friends turned out as one of my most memorable experiences at IISER.

Visit the [github repository](https://github.com/IISERM/GrandThesisAdventure-StressCity) for the source code of the game. These 4 months of effort culminated in a short (~6 hrs) game for a Treasure Hunt event conducted by the Turing club, which involved a simple storyline prompting the player to go on a hunt to collect clues across a terminal-based recreation of the IISER Mohali campus.
