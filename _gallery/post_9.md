I just made my first game with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) for the [GMTK 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) game jam in 36 hours! This was done with the help of [L3mmy](https://l3mmy.itch.io) who did the art, and [Teedoh](https://twitter.com/yaboiteedoh) who composed the music and sound effects.
