Lately, I have developed an interest in both playing and developing video games. Initially, I made some simple games using Python and Julia just to see what was possible using simple frameworks. Nowadays, I use [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), an open source game engine.

## GTA: Stress City 

My first trip into the world of game development. This was made over 4 months of on-and-off development with a team of ~10 people as part of the Turing Club (the coding club) activities at IISER Mohali. The game was built using a very simple 'game engine', called [**Tetra**](https://github.com/dhruvaSambrani/turing-hunt-engine) that I helped develop under the lead of my friend, [Dhruva](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io/). The result wasn't particularly fancy or well-made, but working on this with my wonderful friends turned out to be one of my most memorable experiences at IISER.

Visit the [github repository](https://github.com/IISERM/GrandThesisAdventure-StressCity) for the source code of the game. These 4 months of effort culminated in a short (~6 hrs) game for a Treasure Hunt event conducted by the Turing club, which involved a simple storyline prompting the player to go on a hunt to collect clues across a terminal-based recreation of the IISER Mohali campus.

## Radar Defender

My second trip into the wonderful world of game development. This was made in ~13 hours of continuous work, with the deadline of the GameJam being a day away. A demo is shown below; Visit the [github repository](https://github.com/20akshay00/RadarDefender) for the source code.

## Trickshot

My first game made with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) for the [GMTK 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) game jam in 36 hours! This was done with the help of [L3mmy](https://l3mmy.itch.io) who did the art, and [Teedoh](https://twitter.com/yaboiteedoh) who composed the music and sound effects.

## Summon Squad

My second game made with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) for the [Ludum Dare 55](https://ludumdare.com/) game jam in 72 hours! This was an amazing experience as I was able to work with two extremely talented people, [Jaylus](https://roman-hyacinths.itch.io/) who designed the visuals, and [Gadsada](https://www.eranan.com/) who composed the music and sound effects.
