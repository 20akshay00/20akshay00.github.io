For making my pixel art, I use [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) which used to be FOSS till 2016, but is currently a paid (but source-available) software. It can built locally from the source, by following [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/on9pw6/guide_how_to_build_aseprite_from_source_aseprite/) instructions, but it is certainly worth purchasing as well.

## Phi@I logo attempts

This was my first attempt at creating pixel art. The goal was to create an image loosely tied to the logo of Phi@I, the physics club at IISER Mohali.

## Choices

The ~~good,~~ bad and the ugly of a competitive environment; a tribute to myself and my peers.

## Trapped

A different perspective of the previous piece, _Choices_.

## Entwined

The struggles within. Inseperable. Ensnared. Entwined.

## Another day, another adventure

Seems to be inspired from my days of playing [Terraria](https://terraria.org/). Exploring the unknown is strangely addictive.
