My second academic poster, presented at the [European Tensor Network school](https://indico.dfa.unipd.it/event/1006/overview). I do think it feels a bit drab and unexciting compared to my [previous poster](/gallery/post_8/). But the project that it presents (very much a work-in-progress) is quite neat, so perhaps the aesthetics can be forgiven.
