Here are all of the academic posters I have made through the course of my research career so far. I use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to make them, and not $\LaTeX$ which seems to be a popular choice. The rationale is that it makes sense to use a purely code-based approach as with $\LaTeX$ for things that have a procedural component to them. For example, it would be a nightmare to position things by hand if you wanted images to always appear `x` units above text, and aligned to left, or adhering to any other such fixed constraint.

While this may be an efficient and suitable workflow for things that should be standardized like research papers or lecture notes, I believe that posters should be more creative and free of constraints to be able to convey an idea to the viewer in a fun and accessible manner. Using $\LaTeX$ templates, in my opinion, leads to very cookie-cutter outputs, resulting in every poster looking the same (further exacerbated by the fact that learning to wield $\LaTeX$ to have full customizability is a fairly hard endeavour). As a result, I prefer the [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) workflow offered by Inkscape. The plots and figures are usually made with a combination of `Plots.jl` and `Luxor.jl`.
