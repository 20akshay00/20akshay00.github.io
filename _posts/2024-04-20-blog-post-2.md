Around two weeks ago, something caught my eye while I was mindlessly scrolling my Twitter feed; someone had just mentioned that the [Ludum Dare 55](https://ludumdare.com/) game jam was happening that weekend. Knowing that it was one of the largest bi-annual game jams ever, I had a sudden burst of motivation to clear out my schedule and make an honest attempt at participating. This would only be my second jam (the [first](https://20akshay00.itch.io/trickshot) was the [GMTK 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023)) and I had not touched [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), my game engine of choice, in quite a few months at that point. The perfect opportunity for an interesting weekend!

Generally, indie developers and jam enthusiasts tend to wear multiple hats and work on projects solo (a surprising number of which actually turn out quite good!). In my limited experience, however, I have found that working with a team on short jams was more fun and less strenuous to get through. In addition, having a partner brings some diversity to ideas and reduces the risk of tunnel vision. Typically, a perfect divison of labour would involve separating the coding, the sound effects and the visuals; the three main aspects of a game (or so I thought). This time I was lucky enough that I hopped on to the Ludum Dare [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/yDXXwGbnpT) and quickly found two exceptionally talented people, [Jaylus](https://roman-hyacinths.itch.io) an artist, and [Eranan](https://www.eranan.com/) a composer. Over the next 72 hours, we faced the usual challenges for a group of strangers collaborating over the internet with wildly different timezones, but we pulled through :) And out came [Summon Squad](https://roman-hyacinths.itch.io/summon-squad), something I'm quite proud of. 

![Summon Squad](/images/blog/post2/SummonSquad.webp)

When I went into this jam, I had a rather narrow vision of what developing games was like; but by the end of it, I got a fair bit of insight and I will try to present them over the course of this post. Before proceeding, I would encourage taking a couple of minutes to [try out the game for yourself](https://roman-hyacinths.itch.io/summon-squad).

# The Idea

At 3AM EST, the theme was announced... **Summoning**. Not bad! I was quite excited since I have a great deal of fun with magic and wizards and all that. The first thought is never the best though, and wizardry was far too obvious an interpretation of the theme (people came up with some excellent unconventional ideas; I found [this](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/some-munnings) one particularly hilarious.). Jaylus made it clear at the start that she did not want to make a typical platformer style game, much to my dismay as this is what I had experience with, but in hindsight, this was a great decision. We started throwing around ideas, and this was one that stood out:

> Idea 2 : You're exploring an old haunted house because you heard of hidden treasure & have to fight through spirits/creatures summoned by occult explorers to reach the treasure. 

I thought it sounded very Pokemon-like and loved the concept, although I wasn't too keen on the idea of designing AI systems for the enemy creatures. Especially when we started settling on a more card-based strategy game than a real time beat-em-up, this sounded like a nightmare and I pivoted instead to a puzzle game borrowing the same concept. The core idea was to use mythical creatures to solve environmental puzzles (no AIs, phew) in order to clear a level, and the heart of it would be one thing, **Synergy** (perhaps I had just recently heard about [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/), a wildly popular indie game, and the word just bounced around in my head). However, in the hurry to settle on an idea (as is necessary in the first few hours of such a short jam), we did not flesh out the concept! Following were the glaring questions that we had brushed under the rug in the hopes of figuring it out eventually;

- What kinds of environmental puzzles do we have in mind? What would the obstacles be?
- What abilities do the creatures have? How exactly would 'synergies' work?
- Would the player place these creatures and then start the game (like a [Rube Goldberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w) machine), or would the player have to react in real-time?

All these crucial questions that would decide the gameplay were left in the air since we had to break up due to differing time-zones. It would later on come to bite us, but I suppose thinking on your feet is simply a part of what makes game jams challenging!

# The Execution

## User Interface

As my team mates were catching up on sleep, I got to work to implement some of the main systems in the game to see what the gameplay would look like. Here is where my first lesson was learnt; during a jam it is important to think like a game developer and not a programmer! However, I was very intrigued by the idea of a UI system to drag and drop cards on the game board and immediately dove into that. To begin with, Godot neatly handles the capture and propagation of input events (keypresses and mouse clicks), but it is upto us to decide how to manage that input. The idea is simple; I have a deck of cards, I would like to pick them up with my mouse and drop them elsewhere. This could be done with a spaghetti of ifelses but where's the fun in that? 

Instead, I ended up learning about a [common design pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com) in games, namely, State Machines. Hmm... this sounds familiar. State Machines. State Machines... [_Finite State Machines_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)? It was a concept I have studied before, in the context of the theory of computation. In a nutshell, it is an abstract computational model with a finite number of _states_ and a bunch of rules to _transition_ between them for a given input. Typically, this is used for enemy characters in video games, but really it applies to any object at all that is _stateful_. And our cards are indeed stateful!

![StateMachine](/images/blog/post2/CardStateMachine.png){:width="640" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;"}

The above image shows the diagram for the state machine I used; the circles are states and the arrows represent the input needed to trigger a transition. I thought it was really neat that this rather abstract concept that I learnt years ago, popped up here and made things very pleasant to implement (it also pops up in another unexpected place, namely, in the construction [Matrix Product Operators](https://tensornetwork.org/mpo/) when dealing with Tensor Network methods to study Quantum systems, but thats for another post). Anyways, followed by a quick dive into using TileMaps in Godot, I ended up with this after a couple of hours.

<details> <summary>Ah, programmer art. Beautiful isn't it? </summary> (What's that bar at the bottom you wonder? It was an early mana system that we ended up scrapping.)</details>

---

Now that we can pick up cards; what about dropping them on the grid? Each level inherently has three characteristic tiles; <span style="color:#000000">**Wall**</span> (cannot walk through them or place summons), <span style="color:#696a6a">**Chasm**</span> (can walk and fall to your death, only certain summons can be placed), and <span style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#b4b6b6">**Ground**</span> (walkable and can place all summons). This information is encoded in each level by manually painting the TileMap with three corresponding tiles like so. 

![GridData](/images/blog/post2/GridData.png){:width="640" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;"}

On initialization of the level, this data is parsed into a 2D array which is the internal representation of the game board that keeps track of the game state and where each object is. With this, the day was nearing an end as my mistake dawned upon me... in my fascination with state machines and tilemaps, I forgot to actually implement gameplay mechanics and figure out what they would look like. Thankfully, Jaylus took charge and we quickly came up with some rough ideas for creatures and their abilities. 

> Creature ideas, thoughts? @everyone

>    Flying mini dragon: Can spit fireballs that destroy "weak" blocks

>    Spider: Can weave webs to cross gaps
> 
>    Skeleton: Can block/deflect projectiles with a shield
> 
>    Frost elemental: Can temporarily freeze moving obstacles (e.g., a swinging axe hung from the ceiling)

By the time I had the UI system ready, Jaylus had also made a bunch of the art, and at the end of day one we had a technically playable game where the player could place tokens for no purpose, because there was absolutely nothing to do yet. Further, the concepts we had were untested and we had no way of knowing if it would actually be engaging.

What a disaster! A beautiful looking one at that, but a disaster nonetheless. 

## Mechanics
The next day I woke up in a panic, flooding the clean architecture I had written the previous day with absolutely un-maintainable spaghetti code. I don't feel too bad about this though, since for a one-and-done project like a jam game, playability is a larger priority than maintainability. And it turns out that once you let loose a bit, its not too hard to make progress! 

However, the design choices I made on a whim at this point did result in several annoying bugs in the finished result. The biggest blunder was that although the objects lived on a grid, I treated collisions (from fireballs or axes) in the continuum using Collision shapes instead of simply checking the grid data. This seemed simpler at the time, and it was, but it undeniably made the game feel less polished due to buggy physics. I suppose you win some, you lose some ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

### Creating synergy
I started off with the dragon and its fireball which were quite simple to implement, its simply a projectile that behaves differently based on the target it hits. For example, it is destroyed when hitting an axe or a wall, but it kills any summon, player or breakable wall standing in its way. Interaction with the skeleton is different however; it gets destroyed if hitting head on, deflect if hitting sideways and kills the skeleton if its facing the wrong way.

See what I'm getting at here? Adding a single element to the game now introduces a whole new host of interactions with every other existing element. Thats the synergy I wanted to implement although it didn't happen to the extent I had hoped. By adding rich interactions between summons, we get closer and closer to a truly wonderful concept of **emergent gameplay**. That is, behavior that we hadn't explicitly planned out starts arising out of a few basic rules. It simply happens because it can. Quite reminiscent of emergent phenomena in nature, which is equally mystifying. Another example of varied interactions involves how the  skeleton interacts with an axe based on its direction.

Perhaps these can then be chained in some manner to create a cascading effect. Unfortunately we ran out of time to experiment with something like this during the jam. It still stands that the game shows potential with the addition of more summonable creatures and interactions (such as webs burning upon touching a fireball or getting cut when sliced by an axe).

Emergent gameplay in a puzzle game is a bit hard to get a handle on though since you need to anticipate player solutions in order to avoid cheesing a level with the same trick over and over. In other cases, like the one shown below, the flexibility of interactions simply gives rise to more innovative solutions which is a desirable effect. When a game provides the player with a set of tools and there are intuitive ways that the player wishes to use those tools, it stands to reason that the experience will be enhanced if the game is flexible enough to accomodate such behavior. There does seem to be a balance that must be struck here to make it work in a puzzle game.

## Designing levels
While I was implementing the mechanics, we were running out of time and Eranan came in clutch! He had a bunch of level ideas just based off the bits and pieces of demo videos I sent over the day and whipped up a couple of mock levels. This was done in the most anti-programmer way ever.. using google spreadsheets. And it worked like a charm :)

![Level Design](/images/blog/post2/LevelDesign.png){:width="640" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;"}

Below is an example of how this translated into an actual level inside the Godot editor.

![Level Design Final](/images/blog/post2/LevelDesignFinal.png){:width="640" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;"}

Since the game didn't really come together until the last couple of hours, it was largely unclear as to how it would present a challenge. We knew it would involve placing creatures to clear obstacles, but there had to be some limiting factor that put pressure on the player! We toyed around with a mana system and a cost for playing each summon, or perhaps a timer on each summon that swapped it out with some other card upon timeout. In the end, we simply settled on limiting the number of cards provided instead (a staple choice in puzzle games, and rightfully so as we shall see). This allowed us to gently introduce the mechanics of each summon over the first four levels, thus allowing the player to experiment with them and find out interactions between each other in the last two levels. This worked perfectly, and our only regret is that the game ends just as it gets fun as we ran out of time to make more puzzles. Given the circumstances though, getting this far was still quite an achievement.

# A nasty surprise

![Cyclic Dependancy](/images/blog/post2/CircularDependancy.png){:width="200" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;"}

Now that the mechanics were done and levels were implemented, I quickly threw together the start/end screens and scene transitions between levels. Just as I thought everything was wrapped up and we actually had a chance of submitting the game on time, I hit another snag when I tried to export the game so that Eranan could playtest. Upon exporting, the executable would launch and immediately close. Okay. Something has gone wrong, let me relaunch the editor and see whats up. 

> Error Loading: game_start.tscn
> 
> Load failed due to missing dependencies:
> 
> res://src/scenes/levels/level_1.tscn 

??? Things were working fine just a second ago, and now I couldn't open any scene in my editor, forget exporting it. I started panicking hard, even though I had been maintaining version control through Git, if I didn't know what was causing this issue, there was nothing stopping it from arising again. I clicked through my other scenes and was greeted by similar errors;

> Error Loading: level_1.tscn
> 
> Load failed due to missing dependencies:
> 
> res://src/scenes/levels/level_2.tscn 

...maybe I'd have better luck with the next scene? (naive hope has never hurt anyone >:( )

> Error Loading: level_2.tscn
> 
> Load failed due to missing dependencies:
> 
> res://src/scenes/levels/level_3.tscn 

Did you catch whats going on? It took me a solid hour at 2am in the morning till I realized after following this hellish stacktrace. It went all the way till the end screen;

> Error Loading: game_end.tscn
> 
> Load failed due to missing dependencies:
> 
> res://src/scenes/levels/game_start.tscn 

Wait a minute.. The game start screen just leads back to a missing dependancy of level 1. What? Turns out this confusion was really due to Godot being rather terse with its errors. The issue was that in my lazyness, I did not bother implementing a dedicated script to handle the loading of levels. Instead, I simply kept a reference to the next level in each level scene and loaded it upon level completion. This would've been fine if I hadn't had the bright idea of adding a "Return to start menu" button along with a reference to the scene in the final game end screen. This inadvertently introduced a **Circular dependancy** and Godot didn't know how to handle that. Luckily, `.tscn` files are stored in plain text and I was able to manually break the loop which let the editor open the scenes again, allowing me to resolve this without any git reverting.

# Another one

The nightmares with exporting didn't end there though. In game jams, exporting a web build is one of the most important things to do as most people don't trust downloading unknown executables off the internet. Most game engines support a web build out of the box, and how they do it is frankly a mystery to me and as far as I'm concerned, it is actual black magic. It stands to reason then that it is a wonder that it works at all, much less bug-free. 

![Works on my machine though](/images/blog/post2/WorksOnMyMachine.jpg){:width="500" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;"}

I suppose I jinxed it with this kind of thinking, because the web export was plagued with all kinds of inconsistencies with the debug version. The mouse cursor was gigantic, the graphics were slightly misaligned and most importantly the performance randomly tanked. This resulted in input lag for the player, and worse, the stutters ended up screwing with the physics and let the axes get stuck in a position, breaking entire levels. In extreme cases, the browser started using excessive memory and even ran out of it, resulting in crashes. These issues were wide and varied across different devices and browsers and I had no hope to fix them. In the end it turned out fine as it didn't seem too prevalent, but upon digging into this further I realized that, at least in part, such behavior was actually expected and well known.

Huh? Well, I used Godot 4.2 for this project, and its relatively new. The thing is, Godot 3.5 had been the gold standard for a _really_ long time, and 4.0 came out last year with a bunch of new features and a sizeable rewrite of the engine internals. This resulted in a buggier albeit feature-rich engine, which is still not recommended for production usage. Specifically in the context of web exports, the Godot developers decided that they wanted to go forward with future-proof web technology for their exports such as [SharedArrayBuffers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) and other things I do not understand. However, not all browsers have caught up in supporting these features and thus we are stuck in an odd position where Godot games suffer not because of the engine's limitations but because everyone else haven't caught up yet. Can we really blame Godot here? One could argue that the only way to hasten the process of adopting new technology is by setting an example to begin with.

# Player reception and lessons learnt
With the game built and ready to be shipped, I spent the last day just fixing some minor bugs and adding hints in each level. I had ChatGPT help me with these hints and thought they were hilarious. They tell nothing that the player couldn't have figured out already!

> "One spider's silk, a lonely tale, add another, watch obstacles pale!"

> "Turn up the freeze to halt the slice, icy ally makes danger nice."

> "Dragon's fire, ruins dire, break the walls, journey higher."

> "Armored bones, axes groan, shield held high, dangers disown."

> "Armed with knowledge, face the fray, weave, freeze, burn, clear the way."

> "Threads spun, dragons breathe, one last reveal, in shadows seethe: skeletons stand, flames they fend, navigate their guard, towards the end."


Once this was done, it was finally time to just sit back and see how players responded to the game. Usually in such game jams, the voting on games is not done by a singular judge but rather by other participants. Ludum Dare has a neat karma system in place such that the more you vote and comment on other games, the more visible your own game is to newer audiences (and this is very important since there are hundreds of games). This system is not without flaw, and a major one is that generally people tend to leave unusually encouraging and kind comments (where their name is displayed) while leaving poorer ratings (which are anonymous) which is more reflective of their actual opinions. Rather hilariously, this ends up manifesting in a very cookie-cutter format for most comments, something widely known as a *compliment sandwich*. Here's some examples from our comment section;

> **Great interface! I was able to rock with a touchscreen and a keyboard no problem. Art was very nice! loved the style** - though for level design it was sometimes tough to figure out where the pits were. The timing and movement aspects felt like a side-show to the puzzle of figuring out how to solve the room, I almost wished for my guy to just auto-navigate instead of having to press the direction every square and watch him slowely slide around. **Though definitely still a great submission! :)**

> **An interesting puzzle with cool summoning mechanics.** The graphics are a little off, and in some places it seems raw. Just like the mechanics, who don’t always work as we would like. **However, still a good game for jam!**

Notice the sandwich? Some of these are well meaning and provide genuine constructive criticism, but beyond a point it shows as insincere flattery just to get their karma up. There is a solution though. In popular jams like the Ludum Dare, some participants also livestream their gameplay while providing feedback on other entries. I had submitted our game to a few such streams and it turned out to be far more valuable in terms of gauging player experience. This is what I learnt.

## Game design

I noticed that players initially took a while to get the hang of the mechanics in the first level (the fact that summons are placed, rotated and cannot be picked back up) but after that it was smooth sailing past the four tutorial levels, until they hit the final two levels that require a little thinking. The difficulty ramp emerged perfectly, keeping the player engaged and ended on a high. 

The thing is, I did not design these levels, I merely implemented what Eranan had designed. Although it seems obvious in hindsight, it was only now apparent to me that game design is a completely separate thing from programming, although they are intricately tied together. Game design tackles what is _fun_ to play, and how best to communicate necessary rules to the player to facilitate them to have fun without being too hand-holdy or controlling. This is something we suffered from because each of us in the team were focused on our own tasks that we forgot to _design_ the game! It still managed to work out just fine (perhaps because the idea happened to be fun at its core), but it is certainly a lesson for next time to plan accordingly.
 
## Player psychology

Another thing I noticed was that many players were able to solve certain levels with fewer cards than what was provided. I initially thought these were simply overlooked when Eranan designed the puzzles, but I was surprised to find out it was not. In fact, it was a very deliberate move that worked exactly as he intended. These excess cards were provided in the last two levels which were more intricately designed. The extra cards played two roles; (1) they acted as red herrings, leading the player to think that the solution was more complicated than what they expected and (2) when they ended up solving it with fewer cards, they felt _smart_ (and they are!) because they found a more optimal route than what we supposedly planned. And this is brilliant because it ends the game at a high note, with the player feeling good about themselves. If you think about it, isn't that what puzzle games are all about :) that _AHA!_ moment.

This makes it sound like we anticipated every move though. That was certainly not the case either! There were a couple of instances where players did indeed outsmart us, particularly in a manner that hurt the game. In level 4, the player must used a skeleton to deflect the axe so as to clear a path to walk across the chasm. In level 6, we leave the player stranded in a very constricted area with a set of cards that don't quite make sense (a dragon, a skeleton and a couple of spiders). The intent was that the player connects the dots that if the skeleton can deflect an axe, maybe it can deflect a fireball too. However, there is also an element of experimentation in that they must change the direction of the skeleton to realize that fireballs can be redirected as well. This was hampered due to two reasons:

- An unfortunate bug. If the skeleton is placed <2 blocks away from a dragon, the fireball is deflected but also kills the skeleton. This was not intended behaviour, but some players just tried this and got the wrong idea about the mechanic, thus hindering the solution for the puzzle.

  <source src="/images/blog/post2/SkeletonByeBye.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video> 

- An oversight. Due to a bad placement of blocks in the level, it was actually solvable with just a dragon in an identical way to level 5 (which makes it even worse, since the strategy is fresh in the player's mind). This lets them bypass using the skeleton entirely.

![Loophole](/images/blog/post2/LoopHole.png){:width="640" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;"}

Those who were able to reach the intended solution without the bugs praised the level for its well engineered _AHA!_ moment. Alas! If only we had polished the game such that everyone was able to experience this feeling :(

## Presentation

While the game was overall fairly polished, it was clearly not without its bugs and quirks. Given that it is a jam game though, players are more likely to be more forgiving towards these things  by virtue of the fact that they are also game developers. Even so, the fact that the game looks, sounds and feels good to play did tend to make people look past such issues as well. After all, the end goal is to have fun playing, and if that comes from leaning a bit towards the _aesthetics_ over mechanics, there is nothing necessarily wrong with that (for e.g. I felt [this](https://saveslothstudios.itch.io/the-royal-writ) game is a perfect example here).


# Final thoughts

Through the highs and lows of this project, I learnt a lot about game design, programming patterns and the intricacies of working in a team. If for some reason you'd like to view the spaghetti I wrote, it is available [here](https://github.com/20akshay00/SummonSquad) in its full glory. Overall, I am quite happy that I got the chance to work with some talented folk and managed to crank out a finished product. 

But the bigger takeaway from this is the realization that when designing a game, I don't simply write code. I craft experiences. Experiences that hinge on human behavior and perception. And I have barely struck the surface for there is so much more to learn :)
