Experience
-----
* **May‐Aug 2021, IIT Kharagpur, [Dr. Vishwanath Shukla](https://vishwanathshukla.in/)**
  * Learnt and explored parts of parallel computing, by pickingup basics of MPI and OpenMP. Did not proceed with this,due to lack of interest.
  * Read about superfluidity in BECs and implemented simplealgorithms to obtain ground state solutions. Continued to
read about dipolar BECs and supersolidity, but not muchprogress has been made.
  * *Worked with **Fortran90, Julia***

---

* **May‐July 2020, IISER Mohali, [Dr. P. Balanarayan](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/faculty/dcs/balanarayan)**
  * Explored simulation methods to observe and study the be‐haviour of quantum wave packets in 1 dimensional poten‐tials.
  * Implemented algorithms to solve time (in)dependent Sch‐rodinger equations and transfer matrix‐based calculationsto study scattering from barriers.
  * *Worked with **Python (Numpy, Scipy)***

---

* **May-July 2019: IIT Madras, [Dr. Prafulla Kumar Behera](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/behera)**
  * Learnt elementary particle physics and neutrino detection methods.
  * Worked with the analysis tool ROOT to study various as‐pects of the muon response of the Indian Neutrino Obser‐
vatory’s ICAL detector using simulated data
  * *Worked with **ROOT (C++ framework)***
