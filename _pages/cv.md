Education
-----
* BS‐MS Integrated Degree (Major in Physics and Minor in Data Science), IISER Mohali, 2018 - 2023 (expected)
    * **CPI:** 9.96/10 (till 8th semester)
    * INSPIRE SHE (Scholarship for Higher Education) recipient, 2018‑202

* Highschool, Devi Academy, Sr. Sec School, Chennai, 2016 ‐ 2018

Experience
-----
* **June-Present 2022, Master’s thesis under Dr. [Sanjeev Kumar](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/awards-recognitions/dps/dr-sanjeev-kumar), in collaboration with [Prof. Dr. Tilman Pfau](https://www.pi5.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/)** - [PDF](http://20akshay00.github.io/files/summer2022.pdf)
  * Implemented algorithms (MFT, CMFT) to qualitatively predict and identify exotic phases exhibited in the 2D - Bose Hubbard Model.
  * This was done to assist the planning of an experimental quantum simulator setup using an optical lattice loaded with dipolar dysprosium atoms. 
  * Currently continuing this work by implementing Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms to precisely locate the phases of the system.
  * *Worked with **Python, Julia***

---

* **May‐Aug 2021, Research Internship under [Dr. Vishwanath Shukla](https://vishwanathshukla.in/)** - [PDF]
  * Learnt and explored concepts of parallel computing by picking up basic MPI and OpenMP. Did not proceed with this due to lack of interest. 
  * Read about superfluidity in BECs and implemented simple algorithms to study ground state solutions and dynamics in trapping potentials. 
  * Continued to develop an interest in dipolar BECs and supersolidity, but not much progress was made.
  * *Worked with **Fortran90, Julia***

---

* **May‐July 2020, Research Internship under [Dr. P. Balanarayan](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/faculty/dcs/balanarayan)** - [PDF](http://20akshay00.github.io/files/summer2020.pdf)
  * Explored simulation methods to study the behaviour of quantum wave packets under the influence of 1-dimensional potentials.
  * Implemented algorithms to solve time (in)dependent Schrodinger equations and transfer matrix-based calculations to study scattering from potential barriers.

  * *Worked with **Python (Numpy, Scipy)***

---

* **May-July 2019, Research Internship under [Dr. Prafulla Kumar Behera](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/behera)** - [PDF](http://20akshay00.github.io/files/summer2019.pdf)
  * Learnt elementary particle physics and neutrino detection methods.
  * Worked with the analysis tool ROOT to study various as‐pects of the muon response of the Indian Neutrino Observatory’s ICAL detector using simulated data.
  * *Worked with **ROOT (C++ framework)***

---
