Research Experience
-----
* **June 2022 - April 2023, Master’s thesis with Dr. [Sanjeev Kumar](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/awards-recognitions/dps/dr-sanjeev-kumar), in collaboration with [Prof. Dr. Tilman Pfau](https://www.pi5.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/)** - [\[**PDF**\]](http://20akshay00.github.io/files/MS18117_PRJ502.pdf) [\[**PPT**\]](https://20akshay00.github.io/web-presentations/)
  * Implemented algorithms (MFT, CMFT) to qualitatively predict and identify exotic phases exhibited in the 2D - Bose Hubbard Model.
  * This was done to assist the planning of an experimental quantum simulator setup using an optical lattice loaded with dipolar dysprosium atoms. 
  * Initiated attempts to utilize Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms to precisely locate the phases of the system.
  * *Worked with **Python, Julia***

---

* **May‐Aug 2021, Research Internship with [Dr. Vishwanath Shukla](https://vishwanathshukla.in/)** - [\[**PDF**\]](https://20akshay00.github.io/Summer2021/)
  * Explored concepts of parallel computing by learning elementary MPI and OpenMP.
  * Read about superfluidity in BECs and implemented methods to simulate the 1D Gross-Pitaevski Equation to study ground state dynamics in harmonic traps. 
  * Continued to develop an interest in supersolidity in dipolar BECs and attempted to simulate the system.
  * *Worked with **Fortran90, Julia***

---

* **May‐July 2020, Research Internship with [Dr. P. Balanarayan](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/faculty/dcs/balanarayan)** - [\[**PDF**\]](http://20akshay00.github.io/files/summer2020.pdf)
  * Explored simulation methods to study the behaviour of quantum wave packets under the influence of 1-dimensional potentials.
  * Implemented algorithms to solve time (in)dependent Schrodinger equations and transfer matrix-based calculations to study scattering from potential barriers.

  * *Worked with **Python (Numpy, Scipy)***

---

* **May-July 2019, Research Internship with [Dr. Prafulla Kumar Behera](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/behera)** - [\[**PDF**\]](http://20akshay00.github.io/files/summer2019.pdf)
  * Learnt elementary particle physics and neutrino detection methods.
  * Analyzed various aspects of the muon response of the proposed Indian Neutrino Observatory’s ICAL detector using simulated data.
  * *Worked with **ROOT (C++ framework)***
