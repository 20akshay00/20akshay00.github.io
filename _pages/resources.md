In today's world, there is no limit to the content that we can access for learning new things. I have often burnt many days simply collecting and vetting these resources, making it quite hard to make tangible progress in actually learning the content. This page is dedicated to compiling any useful resources that I have found, in the hopes that someone else may find it helpful.
