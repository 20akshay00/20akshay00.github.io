In today's world, there is no limit to the content that we can access for learning new things. In fact, it has reached the point where we are quite literally drowning in an ocean of resources. Personally, I have often burnt many days simply collecting and vetting these resources, making it quite hard to make tangible progress in actually learning the content. This page is dedicated to compiling any useful resources that I have found so far.


I am collating my resources at the moment, so please visit again later.
