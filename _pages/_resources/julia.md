## Intro to language features
- [**Official docs**](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/): Pretty good documentation for an overview of what the language offers.
- [**MIT Computational Thinking**](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu): Great gateway into Julia for those already familiar with programming and/or numerical computation. 
- **Misc. introductory courses:** [Scientific programming in Julia](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Scientific-Programming-in-Julia/dev/), [Julia for economists](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbuwVVKCI3sRW0Y5ehBFwdFVuyuy87ram&si=kCy1lmn-C20OcKWg)

## Numerical techniques
- **Some comprehensive and broad books:** [Numerical methods in scientific computing](https://www.equalsharepress.com/media/NMFSC.pdf), [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation](http://tobydriscoll.net/fnc-julia/frontmatter.html)
- [**Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning**](https://book.sciml.ai/): An excellent course taught by [Chris Rackauckas](https://www.chrisrackauckas.com/), a very knowledgeable and prolific contributor to the DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem.

## YouTube Channels
- [**Official Julia Language**](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJuliaLanguage): A literal treasure trove of information containing lectures from most Julia related events (most notably, the annual JuliaCon). It is certainly worth going through the ~4 hour workshops from previous JuliaCons. These cover a large variety of topics spanning from basic language features, metaprogramming and interactive plotting to developing and publishing your own packages.
 
- [**Doggo.jl**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwQVlIkbalDzmMnr-0tRhw): Regular exploration into various random Julia concepts and packages.

## Communities 
- [**Discourse**](https://discourse.julialang.org/): The primary forum for discussion
- [**Zulip**](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/): A more texting oriented platform
- [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/C5h9D4j): Unofficial server for discussion

## Package ecosystem
- **List of all packages:** [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages), [JuliaPackages](https://juliapackages.com/), [Julia.jl](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl)
- [**Assorted list of domain-specific packages**](https://github.com/frankwswang?tab=stars): Maintained by [Weishi Wang](https://github.com/frankwswang)
