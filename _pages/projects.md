**ThePhysicsHub** - [[link]](https://physicshub.herokuapp.com/)
=====
* **About:** An open source repository hosting interactive physics simulations created by the cumulative effort of a group of undergraduates. The website was made using ReactJS, and the simulations using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). It is no longer being developed, but paved the way to forming **OpenPsiMu**. Check [this](/projects/thephysicshub.html) out for more info on the PhysicsHub project.

**OpenPsiMu - [[link]](https://github.com/OpenPsiMu/)**
=====
* **About:** An unofficial organization intended to facilitate and organize projects involving Computational Physics on the web. It is still in its infancy, and we have yet to make much progress but it is something I intend to build over time.
* **The Book of PsiMulations:** It is intended to be a full-fledged website with algorithms, implementations and explanations of concepts in Computational Physics supporting Python and Julia. This is a pet project of mine, that I wish to flesh out, over time.

**Tetra: A treasure hunt game-engine** - [[link]](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/turing-hunt-engine)
=====
* **About:** A simplistic 2D unicode-based 'game-engine' written by me and [Dhruva](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io) for the Turing Club treasure hunt event to be conducted online (in the midst of the pandemic).
* **Details:** Written in Python with the GUI handled by PySimpleGUI. 

**Egg Paratha: Exploring Physics with Code** - [[link]](https://iiserm.github.io/egg-paratha/)
=====
* **About:** An initiative to conduct weekly discussion sessions on simulating physical phenomena on a computer. It is intended to be a regular event conducted by Phi@I, the physics club of IISER Mohali. I have hosted 2 sessions so far, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgSU-x37bXpAYmVqgw0UyQA).
