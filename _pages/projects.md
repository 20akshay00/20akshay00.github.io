**ThePhysicsHub** - [[link]](https://physicshub.herokuapp.com/)
-----
* **About:** An open source repository hosting interactive physics simulations created by the cumulative effort of a group of undergraduates. The website was made using ReactJS, and the simulations using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). It is no longer being developed, but paved the way to forming **OpenPsiMu**. Check [this](/projects/thephysicshub.html) out for more info on the PhysicsHub project.

**OpenPsiMu - [[link]](https://github.com/OpenPsiMu/)**
-----
* **About:** An unofficial organization intended to facilitate and organize projects involving Computational Physics on the web. It is still in its infancy, and we have yet to make much progress but it is something I intend to build over time.
* **The Book of PsiMulations:** It is intended to be a full-fledged website with algorithms, implementations and explanations of concepts in Computational Physics supporting Python and Julia. This is a pet project of mine that I wish to flesh out in the future. An early mock version can be seen [here](https://openpsimu.github.io/The-Book-of-PsiMulations/docs/SolvingODEs/EulerMethod/EulerMethod.html).

**Egg Paratha: Exploring Physics with Code** - [[link]](https://iiserm.github.io/egg-paratha/)
-----
* **About:** An initiative to conduct weekly discussion sessions on simulating physical phenomena on a computer. It is intended to be a regular event conducted by Phi@I, the physics club of IISER Mohali. I have hosted 2 sessions so far, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgSU-x37bXpAYmVqgw0UyQA).

**Tetra: A treasure hunt game-engine** - [[link]](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/turing-hunt-engine)
-----
* **About:** A simplistic 2D unicode-based 'game-engine' written by me and [Dhruva](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io) for the Turing Club treasure hunt event to be conducted online (in the midst of the pandemic).
* **Details:** Written in Python with the GUI handled by PySimpleGUI. 

**Schedule Selector** - [[link]](https://20akshay00.github.io/schedule-selector/)
-----
* **About:** This was my first creation to using my newly attained HTML/CSS/Javascript knowledge, to solve the annoying problem of manually filtering through a master schedule to select our courses every semester. It isn't perfect (in terms of browser compatibility, and formatting the master schedule), but it did come out quite nicely.

Below are some projects that I carried out as part of coursework at IISER Mohali.

**Complex system models (IDC621 - Modelling Complex Systems)** - [[link]](github.com/20akshay00/modellingComplexSystems)
-----
* **About:** We studied and built basic models to describe complex systems and explored them using numerical simulations. This was done to understand the emergence of complex behaviours from simple rules. Some of the topics we covered included SIRS disease spread models, Sandpile model and Kuramoto oscillators.

**Signature fraud busting using K-means (IDC409 - Intro to Data Science)** - [[link]](https://github.com/20akshay00/IDC409/blob/master/project_2_report.pdf)
-----
* **About:** In this project, we wrote a script to detect fraudulent signatures by using K-means clustering to classify a sample of signatures provided as training data. While this was not robust at all, it served as a good project to understand the utility of K-means clustering.

**News Recommender System (IDC410 - Machine Learning)** - [[link]](https://github.com/20akshay00/News-Recommender-System)
-----
* **About:** In this project, we (my friends [Bhavik](https://github.com/bhavikorange), [Kunal](https://github.com/kunal1729verma), [Aniket](https://github.com/aniket-sharma-768) and I) attempted to design a news recommender system by scraping news articles from popular news websites. It involved utilizing the methods of Natural Language Processing to build a simple website that recommends articles based on user history and preferences. We used a combination of content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to generate the news feed for each user.

**Charge Density Estimation using Pressure (PHY312 - Advanced Electronics Lab)** - [[link]](https://github.com/20akshay00/PHY312-Project)
-----
* **About:** In this project, we ([Aabhas](https://github.com/aabhasgulati) and I) explored the piezo-electric effect using PZT and PVDF materials under the application of different types of mechanical loads. The project was carried out in COMSOL Multiphysics. 

**Surface Waves in Fluids (PHY638 - Physics of Fluids)** - [[link]](https://20akshay00.github.io/PHY638-Assignment-5/)
-----
* **About:** This is a simple document describing the physics of waves on the surface of a liquid. It was written as part of an assignment for the PHY638 course. Unfortunately this does not involve any simulations :(.
