**ThePhysicsHub** - [[link]](https://physicshub.herokuapp.com/)
=====
* **About:** An open source repository hosting interactive physics simulations created by the cumulative effort of a group of undergraduates. The website was made using ReactJS, and the simulations using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). It is no longer being developed, but paved the way to forming **OpenPsiMu**. Check [this](/projects/thephysicshub.html) out for more info on the PhysicsHub project.

**OpenPsiMu - [[link]](https://github.com/OpenPsiMu/)**
=====
* **About:** An unofficial organization intended to facilitate and organize projects involving Computational Physics on the web. It is still in its infancy, and we have yet to make much progress but it is something I intend to build over time.
* **The Book of PsiMulations:** It is intended to be a full-fledged website with algorithms, implementations and explanations of concepts in Computational Physics supporting Python and Julia. This is a pet project of mine that I wish to flesh out in the future. An early mock version can be seen [here](https://openpsimu.github.io/The-Book-of-PsiMulations/docs/SolvingODEs/EulerMethod/EulerMethod.html).

**Egg Paratha: Exploring Physics with Code** - [[link]](https://iiserm.github.io/egg-paratha/)
=====
* **About:** An initiative to conduct weekly discussion sessions on simulating physical phenomena on a computer. It is intended to be a regular event conducted by Phi@I, the physics club of IISER Mohali. I have hosted 2 sessions so far, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgSU-x37bXpAYmVqgw0UyQA).

**Tetra: A treasure hunt game-engine** - [[link]](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/turing-hunt-engine)
=====
* **About:** A simplistic 2D unicode-based 'game-engine' written by me and [Dhruva](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io) for the Turing Club treasure hunt event to be conducted online (in the midst of the pandemic).
* **Details:** Written in Python with the GUI handled by PySimpleGUI. 

**Schedule Selector** - [[link]](https://20akshay00.github.io/schedule-selector/)
=====
* **About:** This was my first creation to using my newly attained HTML/CSS/Javascript knowledge, to solve the annoying problem of manually filtering through a master schedule to select our courses every semester. It isn't perfect (in terms of browser compatibility, and formatting the master schedule), but it did come out quite nicely.

**Complex system models (IDC621 - Modelling Complex Systems)** - [[link]](github.com/20akshay00/modellingComplexSystems)
-----
* **About:** We studied and built basic models to describe complex systems and explored them using numerical simulations to understand the emergence of complex behaviours from simple rules. Below are some of the topics we covered:
* * [**SIRS disease spread model**](https://github.com/20akshay00/ModellingComplexSystems/tree/master/Report_1) - the SIRS model is a discrete time lattice model with the time evolution described by a set of "rules", and formally this system is known as a cellular automata. The states of the SIRS cellular automata cycle from Susceptible, Infected, Referactory and back to Susceptible, modelling a disease spread in a population.
* * [**Sandpile model**](https://github.com/20akshay00/ModellingComplexSystems/tree/master/Report_2) - the sandpile models are an example of cellular automata exhibiting self-organized criticality i.e. several characteristic features emerged independent of finer details of the system. The sandpile model exhibits self-organized criticality with several observables of the model showing power law distributions.
* * [**Kuramoto oscillators**](https://github.com/20akshay00/ModellingComplexSystems/tree/master/Report_3) - the Kuramoto model describes a large set of coupled oscillators which exhibits the property of collective synchronization above a certain level of coupling strength, very similar to the synchronous flashing of a posse of fireflies.<br>

**News Recommender System (IDC410 - Machine Learning)** - [[link]](https://github.com/20akshay00/News-Recommender-System)
-----
* **About:** In this project, we (my friends [Bhavik](https://github.com/bhavikorange), [Kunal](https://github.com/kunal1729verma), [Aniket](https://github.com/aniket-sharma-768) and I) attempted to design a news recommender system by scraping news articles from some popular news websites, and used methods of Natural Language Processing to recommend build a simple website that recommends articles based on user history and preferences. We used a combination of content-based and collaborative-based recommendations to generate the news feed for each user.


**Charge Density Estimation using Pressure (PHY312 - Advanced Electronics Lab)** - [[link]](https://github.com/20akshay00/PHY312-Project)
-----
In this project, we ([Aabhas](https://github.com/aabhasgulati) and I) explored the piezo-electric effect using PZT and PVDF materials under the application of different types of mechanical loads. The project was carried out in COMSOL Multiphysics.
