I mostly work with Python and Julia to create visual simulations. Occasionally, I use Fortran and C++, but only if I *have* to. As I did not originally plan to display my simulations in a single place, they are scattered across various locations. For now, I have simply linked the ones that I can remember.

Visual simulations
