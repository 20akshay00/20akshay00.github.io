Hi! I am a first year PhD student at [QuantumGroup@UGent](https://quantumghent.github.io/). I like to implement computational models of physical phenomena and create interactive simulations, heavily inspired by the lack of visual demonstrations in higher level concepts of physics. 

The never-ending quest
---

Over time, I have developed the habit of learning a new skill every now and then, in the context of programming languages and niche open source tools. With the plethora of things to learn and the unbridled access to them, it serves as a fun activity and slowly builds up my skillset over time. 

A lot of my motivation comes from engaging in group activites, so I also enjoy working on collaborative projects to learn something new and exciting. Feel free to contact me if you have something interesting to explore!

<!-- Purpose of this website

Mainly, this is intended to be an attempt to increase my online presence, as I head deeper into the research community. But also, as an undergrad, I have often felt lost and confused (and continue to do so) about where I stand and how to elevate myself to where I want to be. Perhaps, I will document my own experiences and thoughts on the path to pursuing research in the hopes that it may spare some students from the incessant nagging of their self-doubt.  -->
