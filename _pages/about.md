Hi! I am a fourth year student pursuing a BS-MS degree in Physics, at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) (IISER-M). Implementing computational models of physical phenomena and creating interactive simulations is one of my favourite pastimes, heavily inspired by the lack of visual demonstrations in higher level concepts of physics. 

I am currently working on my MS thesis with [Dr. Sanjeev Kumar](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/awards-recognitions/dps/dr-sanjeev-kumar) and [Prof. Tilman Pfau's group](https://www.pi5.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/) broadly involving quantum simulations using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. 

The never-ending quest
---

In general, I am a bit hesitant to move out of my comfort zones, but having spent time with a close friend of mine, [Dhruva](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io), I try to pick up a skill every now and then, in the context of programming languages, or niche open source tools that people have made. With the plethora of things to learn and the unbridled access to them, it serves as a fun activity and slowly builds up my skillset over time. 

A lot of my motivation comes from engaging in group activites. As a result, I also enjoy working on collaborative projects with other students to learn something new and exciting.

Purpose of this website
---
I'd like to maintain a record of the the tools and resources I discover from the explorations as mentioned above, to let others benefit from it as well. 

As an undergrad, I have felt lost and confused (and continue to do so) about where I stand and how to elevate myself to where I want to be. Perhaps, I will also document my own experiences and thoughts on the path to pursuing research in the hopes that it may spare some students from the incessant nagging of their self-doubt. 

On another note, I generally prefer making my own websites from vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript (during which, I spend exorbitant amounts of time in styling the CSS elements to perfection), but given the context, I have opted to go for a minimal template to present the information in a clean format without the extra bells and whistles.
