Hi! I am a fifth year student pursuing a BS-MS degree in Physics, at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) (IISER-M). Implementing computational models of physical phenomena and creating interactive simulations is one of my favourite pastimes, heavily inspired by the lack of visual demonstrations in higher level concepts of physics. 

I am currently working on my MS thesis with [Dr. Sanjeev Kumar](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/awards-recognitions/dps/dr-sanjeev-kumar) and [Prof. Tilman Pfau's group](https://www.pi5.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/) broadly involving quantum simulations using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. 

The never-ending quest

I am generally a bit hesitant to move out of my comfort zone. But having spent time with a friend of mine, [Dhruva](https://dhruvasambrani.github.io), I have developed the habit of learning a new skill every now and then, in the context of programming languages, or niche open source tools that people have made. With the plethora of things to learn and the unbridled access to them, it serves as a fun activity and slowly builds up my skillset over time. 

A lot of my motivation comes from engaging in group activites. As a result, I also enjoy working on collaborative projects with other students to learn something new and exciting. Feel free to contact me if you have something interesting to explore!

<!-- Purpose of this website

Mainly, this is intended to be an attempt to increase my online presence, as I head deeper into the research community. But also, as an undergrad, I have often felt lost and confused (and continue to do so) about where I stand and how to elevate myself to where I want to be. Perhaps, I will document my own experiences and thoughts on the path to pursuing research in the hopes that it may spare some students from the incessant nagging of their self-doubt.  -->
