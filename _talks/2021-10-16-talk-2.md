This talk was presented as a part of the IDC451 Seminar Delivery course at IISER Mohali. 

The talk goes over the basic ideas of the Genetic Algorithm for problems of optimization. More specifically, we go through an implementation to find the ground state stationary solution of a 1-dimensional quantum system. [\[Video\]](https://youtu.be/rc1L1j6HBGc

**Note:** The pacing of the talk is really off, as there was a strict time limit and I have quite a hard time sticking to them..
