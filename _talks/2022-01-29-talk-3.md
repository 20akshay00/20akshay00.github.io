This talk was presented as a part of the [egg-paratha](https://iiserm.github.io/egg-paratha/) series (2022) for weekly discussions on computational physics. 

The talk covers some basic ideas of computational physics (from my perspective) and goes on to build a simple framework to simulate a pendulum. Its the perfect system for beginners in numerical simulation and has some nice results such as the amplitude-dependant time period as the system deviates from the small angle approximation.
