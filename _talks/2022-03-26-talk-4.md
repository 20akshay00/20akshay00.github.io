This talk was presented as a part of the IDC452 Seminar Delivery course at IISER Mohali. 

The talk goes over a Particle-in-a-cell implementation to simulate basic plasma physics. The results are validated by recreating a two-stream instability simulation. This talk was not recorded. [\[Slides\]](http://20akshay00.github.io/files/IDC452.pdf)
