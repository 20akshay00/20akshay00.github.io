This talk was presented as a part of the [egg-paratha](https://iiserm.github.io/egg-paratha/old/) series (2021) for weekly discussions on computational physics. 

The talk covers basic ideas of finite difference methods to represent and work with derivatives numerically in a computer simulation. It was meant to serve as a primer to attempt simulating the wave equation.

**Note:** This was my first talk ever after getting into my undergraduate program, and it is *riddled* with errors all the way from incorrect orders of derivative errors upto missing 'dx' terms in places. However, I think the main ideas of the talk are still conveyed, so I have left the video up. But if you are watching it, do proceed with some healthy skepticism (as one always should!).
